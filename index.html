          <p>Akan names are derived from the Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana,
             children are given their name as a <i>'day name'</i> which corresponds to
             the day in the week they were born; of course according to their gender.
          </p>
          <p>Most people know when their birthdays are, but they <em>most likely</em>
             don't know the <em>day</em> of the week they were born.
          </p>
          <p>Hence, this application will use your information
             <i>(that you will input in the form below)</i> to calculate the exact day
             you were born in, and then give you your Akan name!
